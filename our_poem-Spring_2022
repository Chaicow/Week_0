After 1 long year of Zooming, and another one of masking,
Some good times with some great students is all I am really asking.
So let's have a little fun before the code starts executing.
And create a crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:


Github allows everyone to work together.
Hopefully our poem is really clever.


Im so exitced for this quarter and working with R, 
Learning more about Github and how its like a working car. 

I love to code in R, and this is true,
But I have other interests, and I value my free time too.

Coding in R is hard sometimes which makes me want to bawl, 
especially when I encounter errors that make me want to bang my head on the wall
